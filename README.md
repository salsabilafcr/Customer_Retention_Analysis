# Customer Retention Analysis in Online Retail 
An online retail company was conducting a comprehensive analysis of customer retention trends based on their transaction data from January 2010 to December 2010. With the dataset covering 713 users who made their first transaction in January 2010, the focus was on understanding the dynamics of customer loyalty in different cohorts.

## Project Strategic
To extract valuable insights and patterns from the dataset, Python-based analysis was conducted. The strategy involved cohort analysis, specifically focusing on customer retention. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib were used to manage, manipulate, and visualize the data.

The method involves grouping users into cohorts based on the month of their first transaction and tracking their retention rate over the following months. This approach enables a deep understanding of user loyalty and identifies potential challenges in retaining customers over time.

## Analysis Findings

In January 2010, there were 713 first-time users, making it the largest cohort. This cohort also had the highest retention rate in the second month (39%), indicating a good level of sustainability. In addition, this cohort remained loyal with retention rates of around 40% or more in the following months.

However, it should be noted that most users from the various cohorts did not return to transactions, with the retention rate not reaching 50%.  

Of concern is that the lowest retention rate occurred in December 2010, indicating a challenge at the end of the year to retain users.

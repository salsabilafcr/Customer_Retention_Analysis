# Customer Retention Analysis in Online Retail 
This project analyses customer retention in an online retail dataset to understand retention patterns and trends, as well as the factors that influence them. Using cohort analysis and Python, we sought valuable insights into customer loyalty and the challenges in retaining them.

## Problem Statement
Amidst increasing competition in the online retail industry, a good understanding of the factors that influence customer retention is key to maintaining business sustainability. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth analyses to identify customer retention patterns and trends in existing datasets.

## Objectives
- Identified a cohort of customers in January 2010 and analysed their retention rates over a defined period.
- Analysed the customer retention patterns of the various cohorts over the following months.
- Highlighted key challenges in maintaining customer retention and identified factors that could influence them.

## Project Strategic
To extract valuable insights and patterns from the dataset, Python-based analysis was conducted. The strategy involved cohort analysis, specifically focusing on customer retention. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib were used to manage, manipulate, and visualize the data.

â€‹The method involves grouping users into cohorts based on the month of their first transaction and tracking their retention rate over the following months. This approach enables a deep understanding of user loyalty and identifies potential challenges in retaining customers over time.

## Analysis Result

In January 2010, there were 713 first-time users, making it the largest cohort. This cohort also had the highest retention rate in the second month (39%), indicating a good level of sustainability. In addition, this cohort remained loyal with retention rates of around 40% or more in the following months.

However, it should be noted that most users from the various cohorts did not return to transactions, with the retention rate not reaching 50%.  

Of concern is that the lowest retention rate occurred in December 2010, indicating a challenge at the end of the year to retain users.
